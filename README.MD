Found out about [Atheros's founder repo](https://github.com/atherosai/ui) in which he shows how to develop a lot of UI components. I'll be copying some of them to practice.

# What i've learnt from each proyect:

### Accordion-01:
- Details tag: It allows you in a really easy way to display a FAQ acordion.
- Summary tag: Displays the text of the accordion when it's closed.

### Accordion-02:
- Pretty much the same as the [accordion-01](#accordion-01)

### Animation-01:
- CSS animations (Keyframes)

### Button-01:
- CSS within an SVG habing a <rect />
  - stroke-width.
  - stroke-dasharray: Array with values which indicates strokes lenght and spaces length.
  - stroke-dashoffset: Offset of the dasharray.

### Button-02:
- CSS transition using border and outline.

### Button-03:
- CSS transition using border and outline.
- :before and :after.
- background-size and background:lineal-gradient(). 

### Card-01:
- CSS grid.
